# Probability Distribution
For **Discrete Variables** is a table of all possibilities and related to them probabilities.

> The probability of you passing this course is 0.2

| Case    | Prob |
| ------- | ---- |
| Failing | 0.8  |
| Passing | 0.2  |

For **Continuous Variables** is a a chart/plot where on X is a range of possible values and on Y probability of this value appearing. The area under the plot is equal to 1.

# Parameters of a Distribution
## Median
*Value form the middle of sorted distribution or middle value from sorted samples*

---
## Expected Value (Mean)
$$
\mu = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} {x}_{i}} {N}
$$
$$
\mu = \sum_{i=0}^N x_iP(x_i)
$$

---
## Variance & Standard Deviation
*This represents how varied the data is, the bigger the variance/std. the more varied and far away form the mean it is*

**Standard Deviation - Population**
$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2} {N}}
$$
$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i-\mu)^2P(x_i)}
$$

**Variance**
*Yes here just squaring then std is enough*
$$
\sigma^2
$$

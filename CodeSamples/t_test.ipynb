    "\n",
    "In the context of a **t-test, degrees of freedom (df)** refer to the number of information and independent values that can vary. It's a critical factor that influences the shape of the **t-distribution**, especially with small sample sizes. More degrees of freedom result in a **t-distribution** closer to a normal distribution, while fewer degrees of freedom lead to a wider t-distribution with heavier tails.\n",

    "- 1 $n_1 - 1$: For group 1, the degrees of freedom are based on how many values are independent to vary when calculating the mean. We have $n_1$ free independent information from $n_1$ samples. We also get one additional information in this case the mean. Then, if we were to know $n_1 - 1$ values of the samples, using the additional information the mean, we may deduce the last unknown (free) value, in this case we only need the $n_1 - 1$ information to get all the information.\n",
